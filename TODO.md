# To Do

## To Add
 - Explain how to make a site like mine
 - Projects
  - rpi-greeter
  - subreddit predictor
  - ESP8266 GA display
 - Maybe add a date to each project, see if it looks nice
 - Gallery
  - all my generative art
 - Commit all my code to the scala-image repo

## To Change
 - Rewrite stretches.html to use p5 so the code can be a little nicer
 - Have each panel be written in react so I don't have to do tedious work to change stuff
 - Links at bottom of index.html should open in a new tab
