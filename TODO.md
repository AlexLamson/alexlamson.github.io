# To Do

## To Add
 - Explain how to make a site like this one
 - Projects
  - scala-image
  - rpi-greeter with some relevant image
 - Gallery
  - all my generative art

## To Change
 - Rewrite stretches.html to use p5 so the code can be a little nicer
 - Have each panel be written in react so I don't have to do tedious work to change stuff
 - Stretch each project card to be the same height
